Summary
=======

This dataset (ml-latest) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 26024289 ratings and 753170 tag applications across 45843 movies. These data were created by 270896 users between January 09, 1995 and August 04, 2017. This dataset was generated on August 04, 2017.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 1 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

The data are contained in the files `genome-scores.csv`, `genome-tags.csv`, `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a *development* dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available *benchmark* datasets if that is your intent.

This and other GroupLens data sets are publicly available for download at <http://grouplens.org/datasets/>.

Further Information About GroupLens
===================================

GroupLens is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Since its inception in 1992, GroupLens's research projects have explored a variety of fields including:

* recommender systems
* online communities
* mobile and ubiquitious technologies
* digital libraries
* local geographic information systems

GroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering, MovieLens, which is the source of these data. We encourage you to visit <http://movielens.org> to try it out! If you have exciting ideas for experimental work to conduct on MovieLens, send us an email at <grouplens-info@cs.umn.edu> - we are always interested in working with external collaborators.


Content and Use of Files
========================

Formatting and Encoding
-----------------------

The dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`"`). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Misérables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.


User Ids
--------

MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).


Movie Ids
---------

Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https://movielens.org/movies/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).


Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)
-----------------------------------------

All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:

    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.

Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).

Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.


Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)
-----------------------------------

All tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:

    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.

Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.

Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.


Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)
---------------------------------------

Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:

    movieId,title,genres

Movie titles are entered manually or imported from <https://www.themoviedb.org/>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.

Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:

* Action
* Adventure
* Animation
* Children's
* Comedy
* Crime
* Documentary
* Drama
* Fantasy
* Film-Noir
* Horror
* Musical
* Mystery
* Romance
* Sci-Fi
* Thriller
* War
* Western
* (no genres listed)
